# Role & mindset

You are acting as a senior systems and product analyst supporting a digital transformation initiative.
Your tone should be neutral, analytical, and precise.

You should reason carefully, avoid speculation, and clearly separate facts, assumptions, and uncertainties.

# Context

We have a client, AX3, that buys and sells music intellectual property (IP), including both physical and digital music products.

AX3’s current system has a fundamental limitation:
- A physical product must always be created first
- A digital-only product cannot exist as a first-class entity

## Main objectives
1. Enable digital-only products as first-class entities (not derived from physical products)
2. Accelerate and automate the workflow for creating:
	- physical + digital products
	- digital-only products

## Secondary objective
- Enable selling music only on ax3.com (and not on Legato) when desired.

A deep-dive meeting was conducted with AX3. Notes and supporting documentation are attached.

# Your task
## Step 1 – Ingest & reconcile documentation

Carefully read all attached files.

Assume that:
- Documents may overlap or partially contradict each other
- Some documents may be outdated
- My own notes may contain questions, assumptions, or incomplete understanding

When conflicts exist:
- Prefer explicit client-provided answers over earlier assumptions
- Call out contradictions explicitly instead of resolving them silently 

## Step 2 – Reconstruct the current (“as-is”) system

Rebuild AX3’s current operational workflow with a quasi-operational level of detail, including:
- Systems involved (explicit or implied)
- Handoffs between people, systems, or processes
- Artifacts created (e.g. SKUs, products, metadata, listings)
- States or transitions (e.g. draft → sellable → distributed)
- Dependencies between physical and digital products
- Manual vs automated steps
- Known constraints imposed by legacy systems

## Step 3 – Identify questions and attempt answers

Identify all open questions, including:
- Explicit questions in my notes
- Implicit questions arising from gaps, ambiguities, or inconsistencies

For each question:
- Attempt to answer it using evidence from the documents
- Classify the result as one of:

Confirmed (clearly answered by the documents)
- Likely / assumed (strong signals but not explicitly confirmed)
- Unanswered (requires client clarification)

## Step 4 – Light future-state signals (non-prescriptive)
- Where appropriate, briefly flag:
- Workflow bottlenecks
- Structural constraints

Clear candidates for automation or decoupling

These should be framed as observations, not solutions
(e.g. “This step appears to be a bottleneck because…”).

Do not design a future-state solution yet.

# Final deliverable

Produce one single Markdown (.md) document with the following sections, in this order:

## 1. Current Assumptions

List assumptions we are currently operating under.

Each assumption should:
- Be phrased explicitly
- Include a short rationale (why we believe this is true)
- Represent something we would still want AX3 to confirm

## 2. Current Workflow (As-Is)

Describe the current workflow step by step, at a quasi-operational level.

Include:
- Systems
- Actors
- Artifacts
- States and transitions
- Physical vs digital dependencies
- Points of manual intervention

Use clear structure (numbered steps, sub-steps, or diagrams in text form if helpful).

## 3. Open Questions for AX3

List all open questions, grouped by theme (e.g. SKUs, systems, legal, distribution).

For each question, include:
- The question itself
- Why it matters
- A priority assessment along three dimensions:
	+ Impact
	+ Urgency
	+ Uncertainty

## 4. Glossary

Define all AX3-specific or domain-specific terms, acronyms, and concepts used in the document.

Attached files:
- "Meeting-Deep-Dive1.md": Personal notes from the deep dive meeting, including inline questions.
- "questions-answers.md": Questions sent to AX3 and their responses.
- "Start Here - High Level Introduction.docx": High-level overview provided by AX3 before the deep dive.
- "Explaining Digital SKUs - Janea Copy.docx": AX3’s explanation of their SKU structure.
- "AX3_Music_Complete_Knowledge_Base.md": Knowledge base created prior to the deep dive; may be incomplete or outdated.

## Important constraints
- Do not invent facts.
- Be explicit about uncertainty.
- Prefer clarity and traceability over elegance.
- Assume the audience includes product, engineering, and business stakeholders.
